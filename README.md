# Analysis of Trump tweets

Data from the [Trump Twitter archive](http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/).

Requires Python 3 and Jupyter notebook.

This analysis was used in a [Morning Edition radio segment](http://www.npr.org/2017/04/27/525833198/analyzing-trumps-patterns-of-tweeting). However, because this version uses the latest data at the time the notebook was last run, the data analayzed will be more up-to-date than the radio piece, which taped on April 26, 2017.
